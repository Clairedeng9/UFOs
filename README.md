### Overview of Project:
In this module, we dive into Javescript. First of all, we built a table using data stored in data.js. Then we created fiters to make this table fully dynamic, which means it will react to user inputs, and the results displayed into an HTML file for advanced viewing. Furthermore, we customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualizations.
