# UFOs
### Overview of Project:
In this module, we dive into Javescript. First of all, we built a table using data stored in data.js. Then we created fiters to make this table fully dynamic, which means it will react to user inputs, and the results displayed into an HTML file for advanced viewing. Furthermore, we customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualizations. 

### Results
First, welcome to the webpage of ***The Truth Is Out There!***

Next, I will describe to you and see how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria and using the section numbers to introduce the whole webpage.

1. It is a navgation section. You can click it to initiate the page;
2. This is the page header name;
3. This section tells you the name and the subname of the article;
4. This section lists several paragraphs of this article;
5. Section 5 is the filtering section, which you can use by inputting contents for some filters, after inputting crieria, you can hit "ENTER", you will see the search criteria data showing up in section 6;
6. This section lists all data from the data.js file without filters, and it will show the filtered contents by using the section 5 search criteria.

**Notes:**
You can filter it by Date, City, State, Country, and a Shape. You can also filter one category, then hit```ENTER```, and input the other catergory, then hit ```ENTER```. If you want to start over the filter function, you have to clear up all you filters.
### Summary
- The one of drawbacks for this new design is also listed in the NOTE section, we might also include a button to clear up all filters after we filtering several elements in filter search section. In addition, the viewing of data or section 6 is not good enough, City, State and Country needed to capitalize properly.
- The two recommendations for further development:
  1. Add a clear up button to clear the all filters
  2. Create a dropdown list in each search criteria for user to make selections for what they want to filter
